Also, while the Hasura console is easy to use and good for configuring the Hasura server, it is not the most efficient way to configure Hasura, especially when you have a lot of tables that you want to configure at the same time. Sometimes, it's better to directly edit the metadata files to change the configuration of the different tables. You can even write a simple script to generate the metadata files. After all, the metadata files are just some JSON files. You can easily use any script language that can manipulate JSON to update or generate the Hasura metadata.

The client application can pass an Authorization token in the request headers, and Hasura can validate and decode the token to get the role and user metadata.

For example, you can define a \\\"creator\\\" role that can insert, update or select the rows in a table and a \\\"viewer\\\" row that is only allowed to get the data.

It can be done in 2 ways: JWT and webhook. The project that I worked on uses webhook to authorize the user.

However, when our team tried to keep the connections around to be shared between Lambda executions, we faced random \\\"Connection terminated unexpectedly\\\" errors.
