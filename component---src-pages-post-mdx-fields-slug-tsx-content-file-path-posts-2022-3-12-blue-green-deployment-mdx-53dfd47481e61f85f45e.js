The idea is that during the deployment of the new version of the service, we won't shut down the base service, and so there are periods that there are 2 versions of the services are running concurrently. The base version of the service will continue to receive the traffic during the deploying of the new version of the service, and once the deployment is done and tested ok, we can route all the traffic to the new version of the service and cut off the traffic from the original version of the service."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"There can be different approaches in Blue-Green Deployment in a system with microservices architecture."),"\n",o.createElement(t.h1,null,"Different approaches"),"\n",o.createElement(t.h2,null,"Approach 1: Maintain 2 Production environments and always release new versions of all the services at the same time"),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"In this approach, we need to set up and maintain 2 production environments.

Once we decide that the Green environment is ready, we change the route so that all the traffic goes to the Green environment instead. We can monitor the changes for several days and observe if the changes are causing any problems during real usage by the users.
