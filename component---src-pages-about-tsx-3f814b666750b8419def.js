It started with simple Windows BAT files that I used to create menus for choosing DOS games. As a kid, I also enjoyed making small games with Adobe Flash and diving into game mods.","I studied Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology. After graduating, I started my career focusing mainly on web development and creating apps for different smart TV platforms. My interest then shifted to Android development, where I had the chance to work on several media and messaging apps.","Over time, I evolved into a full-stack developer. This role has me juggling various aspects of software development, from front-end to back-end, along with managing AWS services, deployment, and monitoring.","Now, I find myself in the role of a principal software engineer.
