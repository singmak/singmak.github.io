  'I\'ve always loved coding, ever since I was a kid. It started with simple Windows BAT files that I used to create menus for choosing DOS games. As a kid, I also enjoyed making small games with Adobe Flash and diving into game mods.',
  'I studied Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology. After graduating, I started my career focusing mainly on web development and creating apps for different smart TV platforms. My interest then shifted to Android development, where I had the chance to work on several media and messaging apps.',
  'Over time, I evolved into a full-stack developer. This role has me juggling various aspects of software development, from front-end to back-end, along with managing AWS services, deployment, and monitoring.',
  'Now, I find myself in the role of a principal software engineer. My job is to oversee the architecture and development of our software projects. I make sure everything we build is scalable, secure, and maintainable. I also keep our team aligned with the best practices and standards in the industry.'];
