centralized monitoring

ELK not enough

logs could be missing

depends on the api to implement the correct logging

ocean of logs, troublesome to filter out the info we need

how to answer, how many changes? how many correctly synced?


too many place to monitor
- ec2 logs
- cloud watch logs
- ssh into ec2 to check status
- cloudwatch rely too much on AWS, a bit hard to setup the metrics

- cloudwatch - push metrics

- prothesf - pull metrics
