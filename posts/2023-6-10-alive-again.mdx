Previously, I had a strong desire to start a blog where I could share my knowledge and experiences. With that in mind, I embarked on creating a small blog. However, unfortunately, I didn't devote as much time to it as I had initially intended, and after around ten posts, it fell by the wayside.

There were various reasons for this. The demands, stress, and challenges of my work consumed a significant portion of my mental capacity. Additionally, writing a complete and worthwhile post was not an easy task. The topics I wanted to share had likely already been covered by others, and they had probably done a better job than I could.

For years, there was a lingering dissatisfaction that I chose to ignore. I questioned my initial motivation for becoming a software engineer. Was it solely to pay the bills?

It was this dissatisfaction that initially propelled me to create the blog, and now it's bringing me back to this point once again. The purpose of this blog has shifted; it's no longer about sharing knowledge but about fostering my own continuous learning.

My aspiration is to share something here every day, regardless of its size or significance. It will transform into more of a personal journal, chronicling my journey as a software engineer, rather than a conventional blog aimed at disseminating knowledge to others.

#Thanks for ChatGPT to greatly improve my writing :) so many new words that I don't know before.
