In my job, I have numerous experiences in implementing data synchronizations and fixing the synchronization implementation implemented by other people.
Data sychronization is about the handling of changes: When a change happens in one system and that change need to be propagated to other systems, how should architecture the system in such a way that all the data changes can always to be delivered to all systems that need to handle those changes? How
