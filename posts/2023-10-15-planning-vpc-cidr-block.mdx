Creating a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS is a crucial step, and careful planning of the CIDR block is essential for the following reasons:

Resource Scaling: Ensuring there are enough IP addresses for all resources within the VPC.

Network Isolation: Preventing conflicts with other VPCs or external networks.

Infrequent Changes: The difficulty of altering the CIDR block once the VPC is established.

1. Choose a Private IP Range
To begin, the selected CIDR range must reside within the confines of private IP space as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC-1918 standards. Overlapping with public IP ranges can lead to security and routing complications.

The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) designates the following IPv4 address ranges as reserved for private internets, meaning they are not publicly routable on the global internet:

10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
Each of these address ranges serves a distinct purpose: 10.0.0.0/8 provides the most extensive IP range, 172.16.0.0/12 offers a mid-range solution, and 192.168.0.0/16 presents the smallest allocation of IPs. Your choice should align with the number of resources anticipated within the VPC.

2. Establish a CIDR Block Pattern
Maintaining a consistent pattern for CIDR block selection is vital to avoid IP conflicts and promote clarity across your team or organization. A pattern might involve defining CIDR blocks for various environments.

For instance, you can set the CIDR blocks for different environments like so:

Assuming there are four VPCs per environment, each requiring ten subnets with 256 allocated IPs, this would sum up to 10240 IPs for each environment:

Development (DEV) - 172.18.0.0/18
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - 172.18.64.0/18
Production (PROD) - 172.18.128.0/18
3. Avoid Under or Over Provisioning
Balancing the size of your CIDR block is critical. Underprovisioning might hinder resource provisioning, while overprovisioning could deplete the private IP space rapidly, making it difficult to create new VPCs in the future.

4. Examine On-Premises and External Networks
Before finalizing your CIDR block, take stock of all CIDR blocks used in on-premises networks and external/cloud networks that your VPCs may need to peer with. This helps prevent conflicts with the CIDR ranges of these networks.

In conclusion, meticulous planning of your VPC's CIDR block is essential to ensure scalability, isolation, and long-term network stability. Following best practices in CIDR selection can help streamline your AWS infrastructure and reduce the risk of IP conflicts.
