In the last few months, I got the opportunity to work with Hasura in a project at work. The project use Hasura as a Graphql API engine and the web application talks with
the Hasura server to communicate with the database, the architecture looks like this:

![Architecture](./images/hasura-simple-architecture.png)

1. All the communication between the web clients and the database go through the Hasura service. The clients need to pass the query and the authorization token to Hasura.
2. The Hasura service acts as a middle man between the clients and the database.
3. Only the Hasura service is connected to the database
4. Hasura talks with a Lambda function to authenticate the user and also some other Lambda functions for performing actions that cannot be done with the generated Graphql API.

## What is Hasura and what does it do for you?

In a few words, Hasura is a Graphql Engine that can generate a Grahql API based on your database's schema without writing a single line of code. It also provides some extra features such as database schema migrations, data access management, custom actions and data change events handling.
