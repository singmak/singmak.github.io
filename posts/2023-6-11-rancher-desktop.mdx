I am curious how Kubernetes can be run locally, so I did a bit searching and came across this youtube video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evWPib0iNgY

The video introduced the use of Rancher Desktop + nerdctl.

I installed [Rancher Desktop] (which comes with nerdctl already) on my Macbook Pro and tried a little bit.

I tried building Docker image, running containers with the same docker commands. All seems to work just the same as the Docker Desktop.

One problem that I noticed is that if I try to map a port of the container to the host with a port that was being used by a stopped continer, the port forwarding doesn't work. One workaround is to remove the stopped container that has that port mapped.

I will test more to see if it's truely a Docker Desktop replacement.
