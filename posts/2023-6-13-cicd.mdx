Within my team, the current process of performing a release remains tedious, involving repetitive tasks and paperwork that are required for each release.

However, there are undoubtedly ways to automate these processes. By implementing an automation system, we can enhance the quality of every release and save valuable time that can be utilized for actual work.

Tasks such as deployment, rollback, and data backup are commonly associated with the release process. Ideally, these tasks should be handled by computers since they are complex and prone to human error.

I am intrigued by how other teams manage their releases. It is impressive to know that some teams can accomplish releases on a daily basis, and some even multiple times a day.

Allow me to conduct some research on this topic.
