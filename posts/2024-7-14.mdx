I am looking for a logger that won't add any overhead to the applications and can reliably send logs to the Logstash.

After doing a bit searching. I found [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), which claim itself to be the logger with the [best performance](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/main/docs/benchmarks.md).

Pino itself doesn't have the ability to send logs with TCP. We need to use a custom [transport](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/main/docs/transports.md). In the documentation, it mentioned that:

```
The way Pino generates logs:

1. Reduces the impact of logging on an application to the absolute minimum.
2. Gives greater flexibility in how logs are processed and stored.
```

also it mentioned that `transport code will be executed in a separate worker thread. The main thread will write logs to the worker thread, which will write them to the stream returned from the function exported from the transport file/module.`

Based on what it claims, Pino doesn't send logs on the mainthread and so it shouldn't block any application logic when the logs are being sent.

[pino-socket](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-socket) is one of those Pino transport library that allow us to send logs with TCP.

I went through the [codes](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-socket/blob/master/lib/TcpConnection.js) of the `pino-socket` library to understand how the library handle the TCP connections in sending the logs. I noticed a few things:

1. It uses a recovery queue for keeping the messages that couldn't be sent due to TCP connection errors
2. Connection to the server and recovery of errors are retried with a backoff strategy(which can be customized).
