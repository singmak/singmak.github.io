Aside from enjoying my new Xbox, I took some time to learn new things when I found myself feeling bored. During my exploration, I came across a terminal app called "[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)" This application offers a range of excellent features, including workflows, AI, and autocomplete. Using Warp, I found it feels more like a text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, rather than a traditional terminal. I particularly like the workflow feature, which allows me to organize and share the commands I frequently use with others. The AI feature is also fascinating. I can utilize it to generate commands based on specific keywords and English sentences, which can be helpful in learning new commands.

I finally tried [Codewhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/) from AWS. The best part is that it's free, so there's really no reason not to give it a try. It's easy to install in Visual Studio Code, and surprisingly, you don't need an AWS account.
I used Codewhisperer to generate some basic functions with the help of AI. I also watched videos that showed its power, and it seems to be a great tool for creating test cases.

I also spent more time playing with [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) and learning simple commands for Kubectl. I successfully launched containers with my own images and a local MongoDB container. I'll share more once I become more experienced.

I've realized that learning is no longer just for work or future careers. It's more like a hobby for me. It's always exciting to explore new areas that spark my curiosity. If you have the ability to learn, why not embrace it? Learning is a privilege and can be enjoyable too.
