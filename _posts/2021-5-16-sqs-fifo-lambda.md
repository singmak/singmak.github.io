title: "AWS CDK Example: Process ordered events with AWS Lambda, SQS FIFO and SNS FIFO"
---

There are many cases in that services need to react based on the events published by another service. And in some cases, the order of the processing of the messages is important. For example, think about bank transactions, the deposit, transfer, withdrawal events need to be processed in order or there may not be enough money in the bank account to withdraw or transfer the money. In this tutorial, I am going to demonstrate how to implement an infrastructure that can handles events produced by one system and consumed by another system in order with AWS CDK, AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS FIFO queues, and Amazon SNS FIFO.

## Prerequisite
- AWS CLI environment [setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
- Node.js version 12+
- Basic knowledge of typescript
- Basic knowledge of AWS Lambda
## Setting up the project

### Install AWS CDK
If you have not installed AWS CDK, you can install it by:
```sh
npm install aws-cdk
cdk --version
```
If you have installed it already, you should update it to the latest version by
```sh
npm i -g aws-cdk@latest
```
### Init the AWS CDK Project
Now create a new folder for your project and initialize it as a Typescript AWS CDK project.
```sh
mkdir my-ordered-message-process-service
cd my-ordered-message-process-service
cdk init app --language typescript
```

### Install dependencies
Install the depencies required for creating the stacks. List of available AWS CDK packages can be found [here] (https://www.npmjs.com/~aws-cdk-team)
```sh
npm i aws-sdk @aws-cdk/aws-sns @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway @aws-cdk/aws-sqs \
@aws-cdk/aws-sns-subscriptions @aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources
npm i -D @types/aws-lambda
```
Make sure that all AWS CDK modules are in the same versions or there would be issues in building the project.
If not, you need to update the version in `package.json` and run `npm i` again.
### The stack
After the project is initialized by `cdk init app`, `lib/my-ordered-message-process-service-stack.ts` should look like this:
```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';

export class MyOrderedMessageProcessServiceStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    // The code that defines your stack goes here
  }
}
```
### Update the stack to provision all the resources
Now update `lib/my-ordered-message-process-service-stack.ts` to be like this:
```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as sns from '@aws-cdk/aws-sns';
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';
import * as apigateway from '@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway';
import * as sqs from '@aws-cdk/aws-sqs';
import * as snsSubscriptions from '@aws-cdk/aws-sns-subscriptions';
import * as lambdaEventSources from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources';
import { Duration } from '@aws-cdk/core';
export class MyOrderedMessageProcessServiceStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const eventMessageTopic = new sns.Topic(this, 'EventMessageTopic', {
      topicName: 'eventMessages',
      fifo: true,
      contentBasedDeduplication: true,
    });

    // This is optional, you can also publish messages to the SNS topic in any other ways.
    // The Lambda code is set to load from `./lambda/handler.js` (will be generated by `npm run build`)
    // `EVENT_MESSAGE_TOPIC_ARN` is passed into environment variable so that the function can access it
    const publishEventLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'PublishEventMessage', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("./lambda"),
      handler: "handler.publishMessage",
      environment: {
        EVENT_MESSAGE_TOPIC_ARN: eventMessageTopic.topicArn,
      }
    });

    // grant the lambda permission to publish message to the SNS topic
    eventMessageTopic.grantPublish(publishEventLambda);

    // Create the Rest API
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, "MessageApi", {
      restApiName: "messageApi",
      description: "API for publishing messages."
    });
    // Add the path /users in the API
    const apiResource = api.root.addResource("messages");
    const getIntegration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(publishEventLambda);
    apiResource.addMethod("POST", getIntegration);

    // create SQS FIFO queue
    const processMessageQueue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'ProcessMessage', {
      queueName: 'processMessage.fifo',
      fifo: true,
    });

    // subscribe to the SNS queue
    eventMessageTopic.addSubscription(new snsSubscriptions.SqsSubscription(processMessageQueue));

    // create the Lambda function and subscribe
    const processEventLambda = new lambda.Function(this, 'ProcessEvent', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset("./lambda"),
      handler: "handler.processMessage",
      timeout: Duration.seconds(10), // need to be smaller than the visibilityTimeout of the SQS queue
    });
    processEventLambda.addEventSource(new lambdaEventSources.SqsEventSource(processMessageQueue, {
      batchSize: 2
    }));
  }
}
```
### Create the handlers for the Lambda functions
Create a new folder `lambda` in the project folder and create a new file `handler.ts`
Put the codes below in `./lambda/handler.ts`
```typescript
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { APIGatewayEvent, APIGatewayProxyResult, SQSEvent } from 'aws-lambda';

// this is passed from the CDK stack
const { EVENT_MESSAGE_TOPIC_ARN } = process.env;

const sns = new AWS.SNS();

export const publishMessage = async (event: APIGatewayEvent): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> => {
  try {
    const { body } = event;
    if (!body) throw new Error('no body');
    const eventMessages = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log(event);
    for (const eventMessage of eventMessages) {
        const { groupId, message } = eventMessage;
        const response = await sns.publish({
            TopicArn: EVENT_MESSAGE_TOPIC_ARN,
            Message: message,
            MessageGroupId: groupId,
        }).promise();
        console.log(response);
    }
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: eventMessages.length,
    };
  } catch (e) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify(e),
    }
  }
}

export const processMessage = async (event: SQSEvent) => {
  console.log('process message start', new Date().toISOString());
  for (const record of event.Records) {
    console.log(`process message... ${record.body}`);
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // similate that it takes 3 secs to process the message
  }
  console.log('process message end', new Date().toISOString());
};
```

## Build and deploy the stack!!!
First you need to build the lambda handler functions
```sh
npm run build
```
Bootstrap the AWS CDK app to provision resources the AWS CDK needs to perform the deployment. For example, AWS CDK may need to have an S3 bucket to store assets that will be used during the deployment of the stack. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)
```sh
cdk bootstrap
```
Deploy the AWS CDK app
```sh
cdk deploy
```
The url of the rest API will be displayed in the console output if it's deployed successfully

## Test the deployed stack
Since we provisioned a POST API `/messages` to publishing the messages to the queue, you can use any tools to call the API to test publishing messages
For example, I use [Thunder client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) to make an HTTP request with a JSON body like this
![test example](/assets/images/cdk-test-publish-messages.png)

You can check the logs and metrics for SNS and SQS on CloudWatch in the AWS console to check the results of the publishing and processing of the messages.
