title: New blog

Recently, I am thinking about ways to improve my English writing skill so I decided to start blogging to share my experience as a software engineer. A developer blog is something that many other software engineers recommend to have if you are a software engineer/developer since it's a way to showcase your knowledge and expertise and it can benefit others as well.

I have been a software engineer for more than 10 years. I worked with so many things throughout the years, including smart TV apps, mobile apps, web apps, backend, DevOps, and AWS cloud services. My recent interest is AWS services so I probably will write more about it at the beginning.
